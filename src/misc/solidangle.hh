 * Azimuthally symmetrical correction. Fast approximation to 
 * `rigorousSolidAngleCorrection`. See [2].
 * 
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 * num_pixels :        the number of pixels
 * theta :             scattering angle for each pixel (sometimes called 2-theta)
 * correction_factor : multiply this by intensities to correct
 *
 * Implementation notes
 * --------------------
 * Currently excludes the constant_factor:
 * double constant_factor = pixel_size * pixel_size / (z_dist * z_dist)
 * which can be viewed as the zeroth correction to the solid angle (obtained if theta = 0)
 * and means the scattering will still be in its original scale after correction

/*
 * Compute the solid angle of a single pixel, given the corner coordinates.
 *
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 * ccords :            corner coordinates for a pixel,
 *					   where the first index specifies the corner (currently clock-wise from 0 = upper left corner)
 *					   and the second index specifies direction in Cartesian coordinates (0 = X, 1 = Y, 2 = Z)
 *
 * Implementation notes
 * --------------------
 * the total solid angle of a pixel is split up to calculating the solid angle for two plane triangles (see [1]),
 * which means that ccords should be specified so that ccords[1] and ccords[3] are DIAGONAL corners, 
 * and ccords[0] and ccords[2] are the two corners that merges the two plane triangles.

 * ----------

 * num_pixels_f : number of px on grid in the 'f' direction
 * s : slow scan vector for grid
 * f : fast scan vector for grid
 * p : data origin for grid
